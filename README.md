Maze
====
Maze is a 3d ray casting (Wolfenstein 3d style) implementation test. The code is poorly organized - it's just a test to make sure I have the math correct.

C++/SFML is used to draw lines on the screen and capture the keyboard. Everything else is done in straight C, and I wrote my own vector manipulation functions instead of using SFML.

I consider this project finished. The next iteration will use a proper game loop, C++/OOP, SFML for as much as possible, and a different method for wall detection.

Keys:

W - Forward

A - Turn Counter-Clockwise

S - Backwards

D - Turn Clockwise

Q - Toggle between 2d and 3d
